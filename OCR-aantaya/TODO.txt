Task list for the OCR translator assignment.


*Note: 
	-For each one of these tasks, I will be:
		1) Running the test to see it fail.
		2) Re-factoring the code, as simply as possible, to make the tests pass as expected.
		3) Running the test to see it pass.
	-Tests 7 and 8 are not absolutely necessary but will make the test more comprehensive and clearly 
	 show that my solution works on all inputs and digits.


1) Create test for strings of non-equal length. Strings of non-equal length will throw an exception.
2) Create test for empty strings. Empty strings should return "".
3) Create test for string with just spaces. String with just spaces should return "".
4) Create tests for single digit (0-9) with no extra spaces. These will return (0-9), respectfully.
5) Create test for the double digit number "91", with extra spaces in between digits. This will return "91".
6) Create test for "1234567890", with no extra spaces in between. This will return "1234567890".
7) Create test for "1234567890", with random extra spaces in between digits. This will return "1234567890".
8) Do some final re-factoring to make the solution more elegant and easy to read (might have to do multiple 
 iteration of re-factoring).
9) Run all tests to ensure everything still works after re-factoring.
